### Installation Instructions

***Currently the server/ directory is a work in progress and can be ignored. The client/ directory contains some test data to work with inside of the `client/src/testData/`.***

1. Once Directory is cloned to a location of your choosing, `cd` into the `client/` directory
2. From `client/` run either `npm install` (recommended if on Windows) or `yarn install`
3. Once completed, start the vite packager using either `npm run dev` or `yarn run dev`
4. Open the localhost port listed in the packager window and... viola!
